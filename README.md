Developed an IBM HR Analytics Dashboard using Python to analyze employee attrition trends and workforce insights. The dashboard integrates Pandas for data cleaning and preprocessing, Matplotlib/Seaborn for exploratory data analysis, and Plotly/Streamlit for building an interactive interface. Key features include:
Attrition Analysis – Visualized employee turnover by department, age group, gender, job role, and salary range.
KPIs & Metrics – Displayed key HR metrics such as retention rate, average tenure, and satisfaction scores.
Interactive Filters – Allowed HR managers to filter results by demographic and job-related attributes.
Predictive Insights – Implemented machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict attrition likelihood and highlight at-risk employees.
This dashboard enables data-driven HR decision-making by providing clear insights into employee retention, workforce diversity, and organizational health.
